A simple React application that demonstrates basic routing and user interaction. The application consists of a login page and a welcome page.

## Implemented Features

*   **Login Page:** A simple form with a text input and a button. The page has a blue to green gradient background.
*   **Welcome Page:** Displays a welcome message with the user's name. The page has a green to blue gradient background.

### Features
*   **Login:** Users can enter their name on the login page.

## Current Plan

### Add Login and Welcome Pages

**Objective:** Create a two-page application with a login page and a welcome page.

**Steps:**
1.  Install `react-router-dom` for routing.
2.  Create a `Login.jsx` component to handle the login form.
3.  Create a `Welcome.jsx` component to display the welcome message.
4.  Update `App.jsx` to define the routes for the login and welcome pages.
5.  Create `blueprint.md` to document the project.
